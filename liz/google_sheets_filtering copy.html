        <h4 id='sheets_filter_purpose'>Situation</h4>
        <p>Back during Covid Lockdown (mostly 2020) I created a Django Site that stored most of the content in a Postgres database and deployed it dynamically on AWS. When my free year was up, it got too expensive and I was happily working for money, so I undeployed my site. My application still works in development.  I am in the process of deploying some of my content to this site, which is super cheap.</p>
        <p>The data is stored in five tables, with the main one being a paragraphs table. One paragraph can have many groups and also many references. These both many-to-many relationships, so that references and groups can each have many paragraphs. I dumped the table data into csv files, each one representing a table.  My goal is get all the paragraphs for a given group and then all the references for a given paragraph. I am doing this in Google Sheets, where one tab represents on table.</p>
        <p>Note - I could have done this using a postgres data dump, but since I rarely will have time to work on it, given my site takes a back seat to my job and my much of my personal life, I thought this approach would be easier to manage.</p>
