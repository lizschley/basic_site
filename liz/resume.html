         <h5><strong>Rising Tide Solutions (RTS Labs), LLC</strong></h5>
         <p><strong>QA Engineer</strong> (2021 - 2023 )</p>
         <p>Worked with developers, devops and product management to write test cases and perform manual testing, automated UI, unit and integration tests in complex environments. </p>
         <p><strong>Technologies: </strong>Python: Behave, Java Spring Boot: Junit, Cucumber, AWS, Selenium, Jenkins, Docker, Postman, Postgres, DynamoDb, LINUX, TestFlight, SQL, MySQL, SQL Server <span id='rts-toggle-more' class='d-inline text-toggle fas fa-angle-double-down'> More</span> <span id='rts-toggle-less' class='d-none text-toggle fas fa-angle-double-up'> Less</span></p>
         <div id='rts-extra-text' class='d-none'>
            <ul>
               <li>Wrote two Python / Behave frameworks using Selenium, making sure to use methods in order not to repeat the code. Shared innovations with the rest of the QA Team.</li>
               <li>Made Javascript calls in Selenium tests when necessary.</li>
               <li>Eliminated login and navigation time in the Selenium tests by using an API call and sending the authentication key in the header. Navigated to pages only when testing navigation.</li>
               <li>Wrote a complex API-only Python / Behave framework for a middleware application suite, testing Kafka calls, multiple microservices, one internal and two external applications in the same test suite.</li>
               <li>In both of the Python / Behave frameworks, wrote feature tests in Gherkin as a test plan. The test scenarios as the individual test case, with the Gherkin documenting the test process. Ran the resulting test scripts multiple times a day.</li>
               <li>Made it so the API tests easily changed environments (development to qat, for example) by passing in a parameter (<a href="https://github.com/lizschley/python_qa_testing/blob/main/helpers/environment_helper.py">see example</a>.)</li>
               <li>For all manual testing, did the following:
               <ul>
                  <li>Wrote a test plan.</li>
                  <li>Used Postman to test middleware.</li>
                  <li>Created test cases:</li>
                  <ul>
                     <li>Traced the tests to the requirements</li>
                     <li>Documented the procedures and data used.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>Tracked results in Jira or discussed issues with developers and/or updated developer Jira tickets, all according to the team agreement.</li>
                  <li>Documented testing in Jira, Confluence and/or spreadsheets, depending on what the client wanted. Included test evidence in reports.</li>
                  <li>Researched bugs and other issues using web UIs (both the interface itself and inspect element), SQL queries and log checking (Cloudfront, Datadog and New Relic). </span></li>
                  <li>Worked with project owners and developers to prioritize bugs.</li>

         <h5><strong>Teachstone Training, LLC</strong></h5>
         <p><strong>Backend Web Developer</strong> (2013 - 2019)</p>
         <p>Worked with developers, devops, product management, QA, content and customer service to create and maintain a web application to help teachers improve their interactions with their students.  The system interfaced with third party services, including BigCommerce, FedEx and Moodle, and in-house mobile applications and multiple applications using both restful and other Rails and PHP interfaces.  Played a large role in developing a single signon system for both third party and in-house systems.  Wrote many unit and integration tests.</p>
         <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Ruby, Rails, Rspec, PHP, MySQL, Linux, New Relic, some React, Totara, AWS: S3, EC2, SNS, SQS, Aurora <span id='ts-toggle-more' class='d-inline text-toggle fas fa-angle-double-down'> More</span> <span id='ts-toggle-less' class='d-none text-toggle fas fa-angle-double-up'> Less</span></p>
         <div id='ts-extra-text' class='d-none'>
            <ul>
               <li>Created a plan to improve our Rspec test suite, addressing speed and
               randomly failing tests in particular. Implemented bits of the plan, but
               never got company buy-in to tackle the job holistically.</li>
               <li>Built cross-application monitoring for data syncs, using New Relic
               Insight custom fields, allowing us to measure the time from one
               in-house application to another through a third-party application for
               which we had no access. We created alerts and New Relic dashboards
               based on the resulting data. As a by-product, the information helped
               with bug analysis.</li>
               <li>Added or modified acceptance criteria using Gherkin syntax. This was
               a team effort when tickets either had complex business requirements
               or addressed functionality that integrated with other parts of the
               application.</li>
               <li>Worked with a first-time Product Manager [PM], Customer Support,
               course specialists and QA to flesh out requirements, write new Jira
               tickets and to update two separate back-end applications to improve
               the user experience in our video upload mobile application.</li>
               <li>Tested my own code manually either with Browserstack, a server
               running in the dev environment or with Postman.</li>
               <li>Wrote automated unit and integration (API) tests using Rspec, both
               within the application and interfacing with other external and internal
               applications.</li>
               <li>Programmed with HTML, CSS and Javascript, as well as Ruby on Rails.
               3 of 3</li>
               <li>Worked with the QA team to understand bug reports and prioritize
               necessary tests.</li>
