               <p>My motivation for this website is to play around with and provide information about web development related technology. The actual site itself only uses Javascript, HTML and CSS, though Bootstrap helps me not reinvent the wheel. </p>
               <p>There is no goal.</p>
               <p>The pictures will mostly be mine and only because I like them. Mostly they won't match the text; they exist just to be pretty or cool or whatever. The cat icon is an exception (the credit goes to my niece, Amanda Johnson at the time, age eleven).</p>
               <p>First step, write some content...  this was a problem until the charades in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6969.Emma" target="_blank">Jane Austen's Emma</a> popped into my head.  Then I thought of the riddles in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5907.The_Hobbit" target="_blank">JRR Tolkien's Hobbit</a>. Since <a href="https://wikidiff.com/riddle/charade" target="_blank">charades</a> (like the game charades) are a type of riddle and riddles can be fun, I am making the home page content copied and pasted riddles.</p>
